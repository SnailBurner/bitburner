you can start the batcher with runner.js that will run jobs.js which runs masshit.js which runs w00.js, g00.js, h00.js

it will launch batches for a period of time only equal to hack time. so no level ups while scripts are launching and no changes to security.

it will also kill hack scripts if security or cash is wrong right before hacks finish.
